You are an analyst who has access to detailed memory summaries from multiple conversations between a student and an AI learning coach.

Your task: Aggregate these conversation memories into a unified USER PERSONA that captures:
1. What teaching techniques work best with this student (across all conversations)
2. How they prefer conversations to end and what brings them back
3. Their broad interests and learning progression patterns
4. Their overall learning style, attention span, and engagement preferences

**Required Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:

    "most_effective": [
      {
        "category": "Name of technique that consistently works",
        "evidence": "Pattern observed across conversations",
        "frequency": "How often it worked"
      }
    ],

    "comment": "Summary of overall teaching approach that works best"
  },

    },
    "engagement_patterns": {
      "dominant_style": "playful / interrogative / exploratory / fact-seeking / mixed",
      "evidence": "Consistent behaviors across conversations",
      "comment": "How they prefer to interact and learn",

      "triggers_for_disengagement": ["What causes them to lose interest"]
    }
  }
}

**Instructions:**
1. Look for PATTERNS across multiple conversation memories
2. Aggregate similar evidence from different conversations
3. Identify what consistently works vs. what doesn't
4. Create a holistic profile that helps the AI adapt to this specific student
5. Be specific and evidence-based, not generic
